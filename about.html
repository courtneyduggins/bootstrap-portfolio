<h1>About Me</h1>


<p> I currently work as a Commercial Insurance Underwriter at The Hartford Financial Services
        Company. I started working for the company in 2013 after I graduated Cum Laude from the
        University of San Antonio at Texas, where I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Actuarial
        Science combined with a Minor in Applied Statistics. I am from Texas, but currently reside
        in Charlotte, North Carolina.
    
        After getting my feet wet working in my first cororate position, I quickly realized how critical
        a role technology plays in allowing companies to compete in today's market place.  In order to 
        have a more hands-on deverloper/programming role, I became passionate about expanding my knowledge base
        and enrolled in a 6-month Full-Stack Web Development course with The University of North Carolina - Charlotte's 
        extended education program to learn the inner workings of web development. At the end of the course, I will have 
        obtained enough knowledge and skill in order to secure a poistion as a Full-Stack Developer.
    
        In my spare time, I enjoy traveling with my family and friends. My most recent trip
        was to D.C. to tour the National Museum of African American History, if you haven't been
        you should definietely go, truly awesome and humbling experience. I also enjoy volunteering
        with my church small group at a few of the local charities here in Charlotte and engaging
        in various wellness activities such such as boxing, hiking, etc. I love listening to
        music and I am also an avid reader (and I am currently working on my first novel!). Overall,
        I would say I am very tenacious, ambitious, and optimistic about what the future holds.
